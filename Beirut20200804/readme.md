<h3> Local View </h3>
Six locations are selected to test the change in NTL before and afer the explosion. The location position is randon, but the location type is prediterment. To compare the Blast Area (as a port location), two other port locations are selected, and the main intest of the study is to see if it is possible to detect recovery rates, so two residential areas are added to the selection, and finally the Airport is included in the test locations because of the presumed stability in NTL intensity.
